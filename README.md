# ZPD_Seganography_and_cryptography_program
My code for schools scientific paper using steganography and cryptography to hide and encrypt data.
This program utilizes pillow module for LSB steganography and the symmetric cryptography module from python to encrypt your text and combines them both to make minimal changes to the image pixel RGB values to hide data into it and if it gets read then it still is encrypted and requires a poassword to decrypt.
To run:
1. Install pillow and cryptography modules for python
2. Run the code
3. Running for the first time select option 3 to generate a password as if you dont then the program will not work.
4. Select the function you want it to do and enter the required information. (Note: Everything needs to be in the same folder for it to work)
5. After completing the function you'll have to rerun the program to do other functions.
If you've encrypted your text into an image then dont lose your file with the password in it as you will not be able to decrypt your text without it.
